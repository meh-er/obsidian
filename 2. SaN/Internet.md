# Internet

### Limited Connectivity

- Isolated local networks with limited external communication
- Telephone—based connections (slow and costly)
- Dedicated leased lines for exclusive, high-cost connections

### Challenges

- Limited interoperability
- Expensive and low-speed data exchange
- No universal communication standard

## Leased Line Concept

- A and B share a dedicated line to reach C and D
- High-cost but reliable for direct communication
- Limited scalability as more nodes join
- If everyone sends a small packet of data, they can both use the line at the same time.

## IP Packet Structure

- Each packet consists of a structured **header and data**
- The header helps **route, fragment, and process packets** efficiently.
- Packet switching ensures **interleaved and reliable data transmission.**

## ARPANET

- It now connected multiple insitutions using **interface Message Processors (IMPs)**
- The network linked a variety of computers, including **PDP-10s, IBM mainframes, and TX-2**
- This expansion demonstrated **interoperability** across different systems.
- It was a crucial step towards a **globally connected network.**
