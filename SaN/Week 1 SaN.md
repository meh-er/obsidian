## What is Computer Security

- Correctness and Efficient algorithms against an attacker
- What do we safeguard?
- Decide on your assets: Information and Infrastructure
    - Sensitive Data
    - Control Systems
    - Hardware devices
- How do you safeguard: security goal, estimate impact of attacks, design mitigations
- Analyse systems, spot vulnerabilities, build protection

### Information Security: Aims

- **Confidentiality**: Attacker should not retrieve any information
- **Integrity and Authenticity**: Received data is authentic and the sender is genuine
- **Availability**: Data should be accessible on demand

### Some Known Attacks

- **Ransomware:**

    - Widespread impact, NHS and NISSAN among affected
- **Phishing**
